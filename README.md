Polygonal Approximation of Circular Regression
=======================================
PyTorch implementation of 
[Using Circular Models to Improve Music Emotion Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8567988).

## Description

PyTorch's implementation of the models used for the paper.
Original implementation was not in PyTorch, so results might not be identical to those
presented in the paper.

Disclaimer: This repo might be incomplete at the moment by will be updated shortly.
